ti-auth.js
==========

`ti-auth.js` is a small wrapper to integrate modules into the [Travel Intelligence Portal](https://travel-intelligence.com) providing:
- **Authentication** - unauthorized users will be redirected to the TI Portal login page and will return after successful authentication.
- **User Context** - user information, preferences and grants are made available to the application.
- **Utility functions** - for signout and reauthorization.


## Installation
via Bower:

    $ bower install git@github.com:travel-intelligence/ti-auth.js --save

or via NPM:

    $ npm install https://github.com/travel-intelligence/ti-auth.js --save-dev

## Quick Start

For ease of use the library exposes one global JavaScript object called **TiAuth**.

After including the library in the in your applicationâ€™s index.html file only 2 simple steps are needed to use `ti-auth.js` for authentication:

1. **Configuration** - depending on the target environment (production/staging/local etc.) the Travel Intelligence API and the
Portal URL need to be set. This can be done anywhere **before** the first call of the `TiAuth.initialize()`:

    ```javascript
    TiAuth.API_URL = 'https://api.travel-intelligence.com';
    TiAuth.DASHBOARD_URL = 'https://portal.travel-intelligence.com';
    ```

2. **Use the `initialize` method** - to bootstrap your application:

    ```javascript
    TiAuth.initialize(function(token, user) {
      //bootstrap your application here
    });
    ```

  `token` is the authentication token needed to call Travel Intelligence services

  `user` contains the user with its preferences

## Logout

`ti-auth.js` provides the ability to invalidate the current user session. It will automatically redirect the user to the login page.

```javascript
TiAuth.logout();
```

## Framework Integration
`ti-auth.js` is build to be independent from any specific framework. This enables either a stand-alone use or the integration with common JavaScript frameworks.

### Ember

The initialization can be done in ember by creating a custom initializer.

1. Import `ti-auth.js` in `ember-cli-build.js`:
 
  ```javascript
  app.import('bower_components/ti-auth.js/dist/ti-auth.min.js');
  ```
2. Create `app/initializers/ti-auth.js` with the following content:
  ```javascript
  import Ember from 'ember';

  var TiAuthInitializer = {
    name: 'waitForTiAuth',
    initialize: function(registry, application) {

      application.deferReadiness();

      TiAuth.API_URL = 'https://staging-api.travel-intelligence.com';
      TiAuth.DASHBOARD_URL = 'http://travel-intelligence.dev';

      TiAuth.initialize(function(token, user) {
        application.set('token', token);
        application.advanceReadiness();
      });
    }
  };

  export
  default TiAuthInitializer;
  ```
3. Import the initializer in the header of `app/app.js`:

  ```javascript
  import TiAuthInitializer from './initializers/ti-auth';
  ```
  .. and load it with the other modules:
  ```javascript
  loadInitializers(App, config.modulePrefix, TiAuthInitializer);
  ```

### Angular

1. Remove the `ng-app` attribute from the page root element.

2. Manually bootstrap the angular app in the call-back after initializing `ti-auth.js`.   

  ```javascript
  //configuration of the angular application
  var app = angular.module('app', [ ... ]);

  //initializing ti-auth.js
  TiAuth.initialize(function(token) {
    //bootstrap the angular app
    angular.element(document).ready(function() {
      yourApp.constant('token', token);
      angular.bootstrap(document, ['app']);
    });
  });
  ```
